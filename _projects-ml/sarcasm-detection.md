## Introduction

Sarcasm detection is one of the key subfields of the study of Sentiment Analysis because sarcastic texts can often be 
mistaken by machine learning models to have positive polarity, but maybe a negative opinion was conveyed.

This paper proposes a hybrid deep learning model that is Self-Attention-based Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory 
and Convolutional Neural Network (sAtt-BLSTM-CNN) for detecting sarcasm in social network contents automatically. 
Punctuation-, sentiment-, and semantic-based auxiliary features are merged into CNN alongside with the feature maps 
generated by sAtt-BLSTM-CNN. Code can be found in this [GitHub Repo.](https://github.com/qisuqi/Sarcasm_Detection)

Three datasets are used to investigate the robustness of the proposed model: an imbalanced dataset from SemEval 2018 
Task 3A (Van Hee, et al., 2018) containing 3,834 annotated tweets of which 1,923 tweets are not sarcastic and 1,911 
tweets are sarcastic, an imbalanced dataset provided by (Riloff, et al., 2013) containing 877 annotated tweets of which 
721 are not sarcastic and 156 are sarcastic, and a balanced dataset containing harvested real-time tweets obtained from 
Twitter API with 2,000 tweets annotated by the author of this paper.

## Results
The proposed model obtained a testing accuracy of 66%, 77%, and 90% when predicting the unseen test
data on the SemEval, Riloff, and, Harvested datasets, respectively. The figures below also show the proposed model with
three other word embedding method: Word2Vec, GloVe, and BERT.
