## About me

I am a PhD student in Explainable AI. My research focuses on explaining black-box models to make people trust AI and the 
decisions made, so that it can be applied to more sensitive areas that would benefit a lot from AI. You can check out 
the papers that I have published [here]({% link _pages/publications.md %}). 

I am passionate about solving real complex problems through the application of machine learning. My expertise lies in 
developing XAI models, conducting machine learning experiments, and analysing results to derive and explain insights that 
inform business decisions. Check out the projects I have completed [here]({% link _pages/projects.md %}). 

I am currently working for Ofcom as a Machine Learning Engineer. We are researching how Ofcom, as a regulator, can 
assess the algorithms to meet the requirements of the Online Safety Act. 

In my free time, I like to [crochet]({% link _free-time/crochet.md %}).
