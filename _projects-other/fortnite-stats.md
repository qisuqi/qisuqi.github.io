## Introduction

During lockdown, my friends and I really got into playing fortnite. Being the data-nerd I am, I was really curious to 
find out which location and weapon we tend to die to the most. So I learned html, css, and js from scratch and built
a simple web app to visualise the data I collected from my friends. The [website](https://qisuqi.github.io/fortnite_stats.github.io/)
is hosted by GitHub page, visualisations are compiled with vega lite, 
and the codes can be found in this [GitHub Repo.](https://github.com/qisuqi/fortnite_stats.github.ios)

## Visualisations

So all my friends and I died to Purple Mechanical Shotgun the most in Fortnite.
