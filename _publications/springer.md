## Abstract

The paper describes a cloud-based platform that utilizes Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Explainable AI techniques to 
deliver evidence-based, personalized interventions to individuals over 65 suffering or at risk of hearing loss, 
cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairments, balance disorders, or mental health issues, while supporting efficient 
remote monitoring and clinician-driven guidance. As part of the SMART BEAR integrated project, this platform has been 
developed to support its large-scale clinical trials. The platform consists of a standards-based data harmonization and 
management layer, as well as a security component, a Big Data Analytics system, a Clinical Decision Support system, 
and a dashboard component to facilitate efficient data collection across pilot sites.
