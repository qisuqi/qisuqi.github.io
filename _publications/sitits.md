## Abstract

Understanding the factors that contribute to optimal hearing aid fitting and hearing aid user experiences is crucial 
in order to increase the satisfaction and quality of life of hearing loss patients, as well as reduce societal and 
financial burdens. This work proposes a novel framework that uses Encoder-decoder with attention mechanism (attn-ED) 
for predicting future hearing aid usage and SHAP to explain the factors contributing to this prediction. It has been 
demonstrated in experiments that attn-ED performs well at predicting future hearing aid usage, and that SHAP can be 
utilized to calculate the contribution of different factors affecting hearing aid usage. This framework aims to establish 
confidence that AI models can be utilized in the medical domain with the use of XAI methods. Moreover, the proposed 
framework can also assist clinicians in determining the nature of interventions.

## Extension

Using Attn-ED with three XAI methods: SHAP, LIME, and DiCe is in this [GitHub Repo.](https://github.com/qisuqi/Attn_ED)
