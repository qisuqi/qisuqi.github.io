## Abstract

Debilitating hearing loss (HL) affects ~6% of the human population. Only 20% of the people in need of a hearing 
assistive device will eventually seek and acquire one. The number of people that are satisfied with their Hearing Aids 
(HAids) and continue using them in the long term is even lower. Understanding the personal, behavioral, environmental, 
or other factors that correlate with the optimal HAid fitting and with users' experience of HAids is a significant step 
in improving patient satisfaction and quality of life, while reducing societal and financial burden. In SMART BEAR we 
are addressing this need by making use of the capacity of modern HAids to provide dynamic logging of their operation 
and by combining this information with a big amount of information about the medical, environmental, and social context 
of each HAid user. We are studying hearing rehabilitation through a 12-month continuous monitoring of HL patients, 
collecting data, such as participants' demographics, audiometric and medical data, their cognitive and mental status, 
their habits, and preferences, through a set of medical devices and wearables, as well as through face-to-face and 
remote clinical assessments and fitting/fine-tuning sessions. Descriptive, AI-based analysis and assessment of the 
relationships between heterogeneous data and HL-related parameters will help clinical researchers to better understand 
the overall health profiles of HL patients, and to identify patterns or relations that may be proven essential for future 
clinical trials. In addition, the future state and behavioral (e.g., HAids Satisfiability and HAids usage) of the 
patients will be predicted with time-dependent machine learning models to assist the clinical researchers to decide on
the nature of the interventions. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques will be leveraged to better 
understand the factors that play a significant role in the success of a hearing rehabilitation program, constructing 
patient profiles. This paper is a conceptual one aiming to describe the upcoming data collection process and proposed 
framework for providing a comprehensive profile for patients with HL in the context of EU-funded SMART BEAR project. 
Such patient profiles can be invaluable in HL treatment as they can help to identify the characteristics making patients
more prone to drop out and stop using their HAids, using their HAids sufficiently long during the day, and being more 
satisfied by their HAids experience. They can also help decrease the number of needed remote sessions with their 
Audiologist for counseling, and/or HAids fine tuning, or the number of manual changes of HAids program (as indication 
of poor sound quality and bad adaptation of HAids configuration to patients' real needs and daily challenges), leading 
to reduced healthcare cost.
