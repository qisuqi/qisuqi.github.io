## Abstract

This paper describes a cloud-based platform that offers evidence-based, personalised interventions powered by Artificial 
Intelligence to help support efficient remote monitoring and clinician-driven guidance to people over 65 who suffer or 
are at risk of hearing loss, cardiovascular diseases, cognitive impairments, balance disorders, and mental health issues. 
This platform has been developed within the SMART-BEAR integrated project to power its large-scale clinical pilots and 
comprises a standards-based data harmonisation and management layer, a security component, a Big Data Analytics system, 
a Clinical Decision Support tool, and a dashboard component for efficient data collection across the pilot sites.
